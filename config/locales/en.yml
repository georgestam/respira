      cta: The Harder I Practice, the Luckier I Get.
      info_00: Respira is a wearable breathing, heart-rate and speech monitoring device
        to help people who stutter gain fluency.
      info_01: Respira provides real-time feedback on the user’s breathing and speaking
        patterns to reinforce behaviours which reduce the probability of stuttering.
        Performance history is recorded so the users can track their habits and fluency
        improvement. In addition, anonymous information will be collected on a discretionary
        basis, to enable a broader statistical research on stuttering and its causes.
      info_1: Although there are no theories which fully explain the reasons behind
        chronic stuttering, there are many demostrated psychological and cognitive
        practices that have been shown to  help people who stutter (PWS) gain fluency.
        These practices are taught in worldwide recognised courses for PWS such as
        <a href="http://themcguireprogram.com">The McGuire Program</a>, and include
        (but are not limited to) breathing with the diaphragm, limiting the words
        spoken per breath (between 3 and 5), and acceptance of oneself as a PWS. Our
        prototype, Respira, helps PWS to acquire and consolidate all of these habits
        using a single wearable device. Respira conducts physiological measurements
        and performs analysis in real time, allowing it to gently coach the user to
        develop positive habits.
      info_2: With the rise of the IoT and wearable technologies, we are not only
        able to create breathing and speaking habits, but can also record and analyse
        the physiological data and speaking tempo of PWS. This provides valuable real-time
        information for the user to improve their fluency and the scope for fundamental
        health science (in order to understand and control the mechanisms of chronic
        stuttering).
      info_3: Respira is the first hardware product of its kind. Its main innovation
        resides in integrating the latest research on stuttering into an affordable
        device.
      info_4: Speaking at the right speed and breathing correctly are practices that
        have to be reinforced at all times until they become habits. Unfortunately,
        this requires considerable discipline since people who stutter learn to speak
        by many years of bad practice. The real-time feedback is critical to acquire
        new breathing and pausing habits.
      info_5: People who stutter do not stutter always, and therefore they tend to
        use those new techniques only in difficult speaking situations, outside of
        their comfort zone. However, these techniques are ineffective if only used
        when fear is high. This is precisely why it is important to always wear the
        device (in a comfortable manner), even in situations which are not critical.
      info_6: Our goal is to help people who stutter to gain fluency and to provide
        data to enable systematic research on stuttering.

      feature_1: Comfortable belt around the chest that tracks "your" breathing and
        speaking habits during the day, as well as other physiological indicators
        (heart rate + voice pitch).
      feature_2: The belt vibrates whenever users do not use their full diaphragm
        to breathe, or speak too fast, during the day, so new correct habits are built.
      feature_3: Record performance history and set targets to make your learning
        experience more comfortable or aggressive.
      feature_hidden_1: Respira is a virtual coach which is with you 24/7
      feature_hidden_2: We ensure that you use appropriate pausing and have enough
        air in the lungs.
      feature_hidden_3: Your optimum breathing rate should be less than 7 breaths
        per minute in relaxation
      features_moto: Pause, Breathe, Speak, Repeat.

    welcome:
      hello: Hello
      p1: Thank you for registering with Respira!
      p2: We would appreciate if you could share our project.
      p3: Respira is a wearable breathing, heart-rate and speech monitoring device
        to help people who stutter gain fluency.
      p4: Fluent speakers find hard to deeply understand what a person who stutters
        suffers each time that a speaking situation approaches. That's why we created
        Respira, to help people to gain confidence, fluency and live a better life.
      p5: More than 70 million (adult) people worldwide stutter, which is about 1%
        of the population. Our mission is to make this 1% to live a better life.
      p6: Please don't hesitate to ask anything by replying to this email. We would
        also like to hear from people interested to get involved in the project (whatever
        your background) and/or willing to try our first prototypes.
      p7: Many thanks for joining us!
      p8: The Respira Team.
